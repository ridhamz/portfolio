          <p>
            I am Ridha Mezrigui an innovative tech mind who believes in self
            education.
            <br />
            Since very young age I have been passionate about computers and
            programming. <br />
            I wanted to know how do things work in the background, how all those
            programs are made. <br />I really enjoy working with JavaScript
            technologies such as ReactðŸ’™ and NodejsðŸ’š.
